# Coding Challenges Repository

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges and thought exercises which I have encountered during my studies.

All the information regarding each individual challenge is contained in a dedicated folder, within which you will find 3 files:

1. A **premise.txt** file, this contains a written summary of the challenge task.

2. A **.py** file which contains my solution to the challenge

3. An **explanation.txt** file, this contains my explanation of the .py solution file.
