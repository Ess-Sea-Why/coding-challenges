This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges and thought exercises which I have encountered during my studies.

Each challenge has been given its own folder, within which you will find 3 files:

1. A file called premise.txt, this contains a summary of the challenge task.

2. A .py file which contains my solution to the challenge

3. A file called explanation.txt, this contains my explanation of the .py solution file.
